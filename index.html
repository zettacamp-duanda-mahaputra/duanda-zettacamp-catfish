      <p><span>The Avengers are a fictional team of superheroes and the protagonists of the Marvel Cinematic Universe
          (MCU) media franchise, based on the Marvel Comics</span> team of the same name created by Stan Lee and Jack
        Kirby in 1963. Founded by S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Nick Fury, the team is a United States-based organization
        composed primarily of superpowered and gifted individuals, described as "Earth's Mightiest Heroes", who are
        committed to the world's protection from a variety of threats. The Avengers are depicted as operating in the
        state of New York: originally from the Avengers Tower in Midtown Manhattan and subsequently from the Avengers
        Compound in Upstate New York.</p>

        <h4>Steve Rogers as Captain America</h4>
        <p><span>Captain Steven Grant "Steve" Rogers</span> is a World War II veteran, a founding member of the
          Avengers, and Earth's first known superhero. Rogers grew up suffering from numerous health problems, and upon
          America's entry into World War II, he was rejected from serving in the United States Army despite several
          attempts to enlist. Rogers ultimately volunteered for Project Rebirth, where he was the only recipient of the
          Super Soldier Serum developed by Abraham Erskine under the Strategic Scientific Reserve. The serum greatly
          enhanced Rogers' physical abilities to superhuman levels. After Erskine's assassination and being doubted by
          SSR head director Chester Phillips, Rogers was relegated to performing in war bond campaigns, where he posed
          as a patriotic mascot under the moniker of Captain America.</p>

        <h4>Robert Downey Jr as Ironman</h4>
        <p><span>Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark</span> was a billionaire industrialist, a founding member of the Avengers,
          and the former CEO of Stark Industries. A brash but brilliant inventor, Stark was self-described as a genius,
          billionaire, playboy, and philanthropist. With his great wealth and exceptional technical knowledge, Stark was
          one of the world's most powerful men following the deaths of his parents and enjoyed the playboy lifestyle for
          many years until he was kidnapped by the Ten Rings in Afghanistan, while demonstrating a fleet of Jericho
          missiles. With his life on the line, Stark created an armored suit which he used to escape his captors. Upon
          returning home, he utilized several more armors to use against terrorists, as well as Obadiah Stane who turned
          against Stark. Following his fight against Stane, Stark publicly revealed himself as Iron Man.</p>

        <h4>Chris Hemsworth as Thor</h4>
        <p><span>Thor Odinson is the Asgardian God of Thunder</span>, the former king of Asgard and New Asgard, and a
          founding member of the Avengers. When his irresponsible and impetuous behavior reignited an ancient war
          between Asgard and Jotunheim, Thor was denied the right to become king, stripped of his power and hammer
          Mj√∏lnir, and banished to Earth by Odin. While exiled on Earth, Thor learned humility, finding love with Jane
          Foster, and helped save his new friends from the Destroyer sent by Loki. Due to his selfless act of sacrifice,
          Thor redeemed himself in his father's eyes and was granted his power once more, which he then used to defeat
          Loki's schemes of genocide.</p>

        <h4>Mark Ruffalo as Hulk</h4>
        <p><span>Doctor Robert Bruce Banner, M.D., Ph.D.,</span> is a renowned scientist and a founding member of the
          Avengers. Highly respected for his work in biochemistry, nuclear physics and gamma radiation, Banner was
          tasked by Thaddeus Ross to recreate the Super Soldier Serum that created Captain America. However, Ross
          elected not to inform Banner what he was creating. During the experiment, Banner substituted vita radiation
          for gamma radiation and administered the serum on himself. As a result, the mild-mannered scientist found that
          when angered, provoked or excited, his body and brain would transform into a huge, rage-fueled,
          primitive-minded creature known as the Hulk.</p>
